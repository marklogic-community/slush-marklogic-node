# MarkLogic-Node Generator

This application was generated by the MarkLogic-Node [Slush](https://github.com/klei/slush) generator, with the following components:

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/): very thin layer, hosting the Angular code and proxying MarkLogic REST API requests
- [Roxy Deployer](https://github.com/marklogic/roxy): bootstrap MarkLogic databases, application servers, etc; scaffolding for MarkLogic REST API service extensions

# Running the application

- `$ ./ml local bootstrap`
- `$ ./ml local deploy modules`
- edit gulpfile.js. In the options section near the top, set your desired ports
- `$ gulp` # this will watch the .less file for changes and compile them to .css
- `$ gulp server`

# Data
## Sample Data
The application comes with 25 JSON documents generated by json-generator.com. You can load them with MLCP like this:

    $ /path/to/mlcp.sh import  -username admin -password admin -host localhost -port 8041 -input_file_path data -document_type text -transform_module /transform/from-json.xqy  -transform_namespace "http://marklogic.com/transform/from-json"  -transform_function transform

Replace the username and password if needed. The to-json.xqy module is provided in the sample application under the src/transform directory.

## General Data Information
The application assumes that you're storing JSON data. This shows up in the default format request for the MLRest service's searchContext, the detailController's (detail-ctrl.js) request to get a document, and in the out-of-the-box detail view.
